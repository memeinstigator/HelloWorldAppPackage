# This entire directory tree (rooted at the directory containing this descriptor.yml file) is a sample platform application package.
 
# URL-friendly code name for the app. 
name: helloworld
 
# Human-readable app name.
display_name: "Hellow Sample Application"

# Application-level version number. Must be major.minor.etc style, with as many components as you like, with the usual sort order for
# determining which of two versions is newer. (No "newer" ordering actually implemented in first release.)
# typical example; 61672 is build number
version: 1.0.0
 
# Note: You can publish a given (name, version) combo exactly once to a platform instance. 
# In other words, name + version is a primary key for this app version. 
# (The "display-name" field is for display only and can be anything.)


# You can add app-specific preferences here with default values
# e.g. this is from Clarity Playbook
# preferences:
#   - prefKey: APP_URL
#     value: playbook/${tenantId}/sp/start
